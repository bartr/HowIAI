## Episode 1: Creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

In this episode, I am going to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) using GitHub Copilot.

My requirements are captured in what I call a "stream of consciousness" markdown document - `gov.md`. This document serves as the foundation for the PRD, allowing me to extract key information and structure it appropriately. The document has little to no formatting and is basically a bulleted list of things to include.

I find that using this type of list as a starting point is a very effective way to ensure that all relevant information is captured. I let the LLM worry about organizing and formatting as it's quite good at that.

## The GitHub Copilot prompt I use

- use the instructions at https://github.com/bartr/HowIAI/blob/main/tasks/create-prd.mdc and the template at https://github.com/bartr/HowIAI/blob/main/tasks/prd-template.md to create a new PRD. Save the PRD as PRD.md
- use the stream of consciousness markdown document https://github.com/bartr/HowIAI/blob/episode-1/gov.md as the source of information for the PRD
